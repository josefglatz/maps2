![Build Status](https://github.com/jweiland-net/maps2/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

This TYPO3 extension supports the rendering of a map based on Google Maps or
OpenStreetMap. The map can be additionally enriched with markers, routes,
area and radius overlays and these overlays can be grouped into categories
for easy and recurring assignment.
